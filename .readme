A project to sets up a PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin web interface using Docker Compose. It includes two services:
 
 - a PostgreSQL container (pgdatabase) with persistent data storage, and 
 - a pgAdmin container (pgadmin) for managing and visualizing the database. 
 
 The containers are connected via a custom network (pg-network), allowing for interaction between the database and the admin interface. Data persistence is ensured with Docker volumes, enabling data to survive container restarts.
